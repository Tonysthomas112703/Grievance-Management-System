# Grievance-Management-System
<p>
The Grievance Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline the process of lodging, assigning, and resolving user grievances. The system includes three roles: User, Assignee, and Technician, each with specific functions:

User: Submits grievances related to products or services.
Assignee: Reviews grievances, checks technician availability, and assigns grievances accordingly.
Technician: Resolves assigned grievances and updates the status.
The system features secure authentication for each role, role-based dashboards, and APIs for managing grievances and user registration. It integrates Spring Boot (Java) for the backend, PostgreSQL for database management, and React for the frontend. The system ensures efficient tracking, assignment, and resolution of grievances with real-time status updates for all stakeholders.
